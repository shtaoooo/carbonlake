# Welcome to CarbonLake Quickstart CDK Application

CarbonLake Quickstart (CLQS) is a decarbonization data accelerator solution built on existing AWS Services. CarbonLake Quickstart reduces the undifferentiated heavy lifting of ingesting, standardizing, transforming, and calculating carbon and ghg emission data so that customers can build decarbonization reporting, forecasting, and analytics solutions and products for internal and external use. CarbonLake includes a purpose-built data pipeline, data quality module, data lineage module, emissions calculator microservice, business intelligency services, prebuilt forecasting machine learning notebook and compute service, GraphQL API, and sample web application. CarbonLake data is ingested through the CarbonLake landing zone, and can be ingested from any service within or connected to the AWS cloud.

## üõ† What you will build

![CarbonLake architectural diagram](resources/architecture/carbonlake-quickstart-v1-architecture-image.png)

### Shared Resource Stack

The shared resource stack deploys all cross-stack referenced resources such as S3 buckets and lambda functions that are built as dependencies.

### Optional CI/CD Pipeline

The optional CI/CD pipeline using AWS Codecommit, AWS Codebuild, AWS Codepipeline, and AWS Codedeploy to manage a self-mutating CDK pipeline. This pipeline can pick up commits to a defined branch of a github, gitlab, or codecommit repository and push them through an AWS DevOps services workflow.

### Data Pipeline

The CarbonLake data pipeline is an event-driven Step Functions Workflow triggered by each upload to the CarbonLake Landing Zone S3 bucket. The data pipeline performs the following functions:

1. AWS Glue Data Brew Data Quality Check: If the data quality check passes the data is passed to the next step. If the data quality check fails the admin user receives a Simple Notification Services alert via email.
2. Data Transformation Glue Workflow: Batch records are transformed and prepared for the CarbonLake calculator microservice.
3. Data Compaction: night data compaction jobs prepare data for analytics and machine learning workloads.
4. Emissions Calculator Lambda Microservice: An AWS Lambda function performed emissions factor database lookup and calculation, outputting records to a DynamoDB table and to an S3 bucket for analytics and AI/ML application.
5. Data Transformation Ledger: Each transformation of data is recorded to a ledger using Amazon Simple Queue Service, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Dynamo DB.

### Emissions Factor Reference Databases preseeded in a DynamoDB table

The Carbon Emissions Calculator Microservice comes with a pre-seeded Amazon DynamoDB reference table. This data model directly references the World Resource Institute GHG Protocol model.

### AWS AppSync GraphQL API

A pre-built AWS AppSync GraphQL API provides flexible querying for application integration. This GraphQL API is authorized using Amazon Cognito User Pools and comes with a predefined Admin and Basic User role. This GraphQL API is used for integration with the CarbonLake AWS Amplify Sample Web Application.

### Optional: AWS Amplify Sample Web Application

An AWS Amplify application can be deployed optionally and hosted via Amazon Cloudfront. The AWS Amplify application references the outputs of a full successful CarbonLake Quickstart deployment and requires additional manual deployment steps outlines in the associated module README file.

### Optional: Amazon Quicksight Module with prebuilt visualizations and Analysis

An Amazon Quicksight stack can be deployed optionally with pre-built visualizations for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. This stack requires additional manual setup in the AWS console detailed in this guide.

### Optional: Sagemaker Notebook Instance with pre-built Machine Learning notebook

A pre-built machine learning notebook is deployed on an Amazon Sagemaker Notebook EC2 instance with `.ipynb` and pre-built prompts and functions.

### Sample Data Collection for Testing

The CarbonLake Quickstart application comes with sample data for testing successful deployment of the application and can be found in teh `resource/sample-data` directory.

## üí≤ Cost and Licenses

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Quick Start reference deployment. There is no additional cost for using this Quick Start.  

The AWS CloudFormation templates for this Quick Start include configuration parameters that you can customize. Some of these settings, such as instance type, affect the cost of deployment. For cost estimates, see the pricing pages for each AWS service you use. Prices are subject to change.

Tip: After you deploy the Quick Start,  create AWS Cost and Usage Reports to track costs associated with the Quick Start. These reports deliver billing metrics to an S3 bucket in your account. They provide cost estimates based on usage throughout each month and aggregate the data at the end of the month. For more information, see  What are AWS Cost and Usage Reports?

This Quick Start doesn‚Äôt require any software license or AWS Marketplace subscription.

## How to Deploy

You can deploy CarbonLake Quickstart through the manual setup process using AWS CDK. We recommend use of an AWS Cloud9 instance in your AWS account or VS Code and the AWS CLI. We also generally recommend a fresh AWS account that can be integrating with your existing infrastructure using AWS Organizations.

## üéí Pre-requisites

- The [aws-cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) must be installed *and* configured with an AWS account on the deployment machine (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html for instructions on how to do this on your preferred development platform).
- This project requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). To make sure you have it available on your machine, try running the following command.
  ```sh
  node -v
  ```
- For best experience we recommend installing CDK globally: `npm install -g aws-cdk`

## üöÄ Setup

### 0/ Use git to clone this repository to your local environment

```sh
git clone #insert-http-or-ssh-for-this-repository
```

### 1/ Set up your AWS environment

* Configure your AWS credentials --> `aws configure`
* Get your AWS Account Number --> `aws sts get-caller-identity`
* Bootstrap CDK so that you can build cdk assets --> `cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER/REGION` or `cdk bootstrap` if you are authenticated through aws configure

### 2/ Prepare your CDK environment (Manual Setup)

1. Navigate to CDK Directory
2. Set `cdk.context.json` values --> The `cdk.context.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit the context and parameters for your app.

#### **Context Parameters**

Before deployment navigate to `cdk.context.json` and update the required context parameters which include: `adminEmail`, and `repoBranch`. Review the optional and required context variables below.

- Required:`adminEmail` The email address for the administrator of the app
- Required:`repoBranch` The branch to deploy in your pipeline (default is `/main`)
- Optional:`quicksightUserName` Username for access to the carbon emissions dataset and dashboard.
- Optional:`deployQuicksightStack` Determines whether this stack is deployed. Default is false, change to `true` if you want to deploy this stack.
- Optional:`deploySagemakerStack` Determines whether this stack is deployed. Default is false, change to `true` if you want to deploy this stack.
Note: If you choose to deploy the optional Quicksight Module make sure you review [QuickSight setup instructions](lib/quicksight/documentation/README.md)

### 3/ Install dependencies, build, and synthesize the CDK app

- Install dependencies

```sh
npm ci
```

- Build your node application and environment

```sh
npm run build
```

- Synthesize the CDK application

```sh
cdk synth
```

### 4/ Deploy the application

- ‚úÖ  Recommended: deploy for local development

```sh
cdk deploy --all
```

üëÜ If you are deploying only for local development this will deploy all of the CarbonLake stacks without the CI/CD pipeline. This is recommended.

- ‚õîÔ∏è  Advanced User: deploy through CI/CD pipeline with linked repository

```sh
npm run deploy:cicd
```

üëÜ If you are deploying the full CI/CD pipeline will deploy the pipeline and you will have to connect your repo for automated deployment. Use the [README for the gitlab mirroring component](lib/ci-cd/gitlab-mirroring-aws-remove-later/README.md) to get set up. Please note that this will require some knowledge of DevOps services in AWS and is considered an advanced implementation.

### 4/ Set up the Amplify Web Application

To really test out the CarbonLake Quickstart please follow the [Web Application README](front-end/carbonlake-ui/documentation/README.md) to manually deploy the AWS Amplify sample web application.

### Optional A/ Manually enable & set up Amazon Quicksight Stack

If you choose to deploy the Amazon Quicksight business intelligence stack it will include prebuilt data visualizations that leverage Amazon Athena to query your processed data. If you elect to deploy this stack you will need to remove the comments 

Before you proceed you need to set up your quicksight account and user. This needs to be done manually in the console, so please open this link and follow the instructions [here](lib/stacks/stack-quicksight/documentation/README.md).

To deploy this stack navigate to `cdk.context.json` and change `deployQuicksightStack` value to `true` and redeploy the application by running `cdk deploy --all`

### Optional B/ Manually enable & set up Forecast stack

The forecast stack includes a pre-built sagemaker notebook instance running an `.ipynb` with embedded machine learning tools and prompts. 

To deploy this stack navigate to `cdk.context.json` and change `deploySagemakerStack` value to `true` and redeploy the application by running `cdk deploy --all`

## üõ† Usage

Time to get started using CarbonLake Quickstart! Follow the steps below to see if everything is working and get familiar with this solution.

### 1/ Make sure all the infrastructure deployed properly

In your command line shell you should see confirmation of all resources deploying. Did they deploy successfully? Any errors or issues? If all is successful you should see indication that CDK deployed. You can also verify this by navigating to the Cloudformation service in the AWS console. Visually check the series of stacks that all begin with `CLQS` to see that they deployed successfully. You can also search for the tag: 

```json 

"application": "carbonlake" 

```

### 2/ Drop some synthetic test data into the CarbonLake Landing Zone S3 Bucket

Time to test some data out and see if everything is working. This section assumes basic prerequisite knowledge of how to manually upload an object to S3 with the AWS console. For more on this please review [how to upload an object to S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/upload-objects.html).

- Go to the S3 console and locate your CarbonLake landing zone bucket it will be called `carbonlakepipelinestack-carbonlakelandingbucket` with a unique identifier appended to it
- Upload [CarbonLakeQS Synthetic Input Data](sample-data/carbon-lake-synthetic-input-data.csv) to the S3 bucket manually
- This will kick trigger the pipeline kickoff lambda function and start the data pipeline step functions workflow -- continue!

### 3/ Take a look at the step functions workflow

- Navigate to step functions service in the aws console
- Select the step function named `carbonlakePipeline` with an appended uuid
- Select the recent active workflow
- Select from the "executions" list
- Have a quick look and familiarize yourself with the workflow graph inspector
- The workflow will highlight green for each passed step. See two image examples below.

Figure. In progress step function workflow

![Successful Step Functions Workflow](resources/carbonlake-quickstart-step-func-graph-inspector-completed.png)
Figure. Completed step function workflow

### 4/ Query your GraphQL API endpoint

- Navigate to AWS AppSync in the console
- In the AWS AppSync, choose the Queries tab and then enter the following text in the editor:
- Run the following query and hit "run"

This one will get all of the records (with a default limit of 10)
```
query MyQuery {
  all {
    items {
      activity
      activity_event_id
      asset_id
      category
      emissions_output
      geo
      origin_measurement_timestamp
      raw_data
      units
      source
      scope
    }
  }
}
```
Did that all work? Continue...

### 5/ Take a look at the Amplify Sample Web Application

If you have not yet this is a great time to deploy the sample web application. Once you've run some data throught the pipeline you should see that successfully populating in the application. Please follow the [Web Application README](front-end/carbonlake-ui/documentation/README.md) to manually deploy the AWS Amplify sample web application.

### 6/ Try dropping some other sample data into the landing zone

- Generate or select some additional data (it can be anything really, but carbon emissions data is good)
- Test out the data quality module by dropping different data into the bucket. Does it run through? Do you get a notification if it does not?

### 7/ Start connecting your own data to the CarbonLake landing zone

- Connect other data sources such as IoT, Streaming Data, Database Migration Workloads, or other applications to the S3 landing zone bucket. Try something out and let us know how it goes.
